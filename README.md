How to use:

1. Copy path of Song Beater folder
2. While this app runs saved levels in that folder will be renamed to level variants (e.g. 4.json → becomes → 4-225-R2R0L1L1R1R0L2L2R3R0L3L3R3R0L2L2R1R0L0L0.json (showing the note count and first 20 notes in the file)
3. When you have at least 2 variants of the same level you can merge the variants into a mixed level (where chuncks of min..max orbs are taken randomly from the variants)
4. Note counts in main jb.json file are updated, and video if found is also added.
