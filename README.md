# Song-Beater-Map-Mixer
Mix multiple Song Beater auto-generated maps with various settings into a single composite map

How to use:

1. Copy path of Song Beater folder
2. While this app runs saved levels in that folder will be renamed to level variants
3. When you have at least 2 variants of the same level you can merge the variants into a mixed level (where chuncks of min..max orbs are taken randomly from the variants)
4. Note counts in main jb.json file are updated, and video if found is also added.

Any questions, ask me on the Song Beater discord
